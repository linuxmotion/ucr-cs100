Welcome all, for those of you who are reading this you may have heard of a program that is 
called git that is used to manage the source code of various projects.

Note: All text with <TEXT> means to replace TEXT with the proper text/path/name
For these examples we will be using github.com, which you can create an account for free at.

##SECTION B: Install from package manger
All systems will install from the command line 

	Debian-based: 
	$ sudo apt-get install git-core


#Section C: Git basics
After git is installed you should setup a couple of setting

	$ git config --global user.name "<your name>"
	$ git config --global user.email "<your email>"

Try not to think of git as a complex program but as many simple programs 
rolled into one, each with there own purpose. Almost all of Git's commands 
are prefixed by.... you guessed it, $git.

So to start of lets get an already created git repository or "repo".

	$ git clone https://github.com/mikeizbicki/ucr-cs100.git

This shell command means invoke the git command and create a git repo called ucr-cs100
using the information from the url to grab the data. This is the most basic of commands.
 Optionally you can specify the directory to clone into is called by adding it after the URL.
	
	$ git clone https://github.com/mikeizbicki/ucr-cs100.git CS100

Now lets say you whant to create a new git repo from scratch. We create a 
new clean git directory by first creating a empty directory. After the directory 
is created we will then initialize the repo.

	$ mkdir <name>
	$ cd <name>
	$ git init

Now that the repo is initialized we can add some files to repository.  We add files to git 
repository by first creating a file then using 'git add <files>'. Here I am telling git to 
include all the files the are in the current working directory, optionally you can individually 
specify which files to include.
	
	$ touch README
	$ git add .
		Or
	$ git add <path_to_file_in_git_repo>

Once the files are added we can then 'commit' them to the repo. 'Committing' means that 
we want to include that file in the repository and track the changes that are made to that file. 
Commits are the saved state of the repo. Commits take a message that allows them to be looked over 
with a title and message so that users can tell what has happened.  If 'git commit' is used
 without passing the -m flag, or message flag, the default text editor will be brought up to 
prepare a message for the commit. 

	$ git commit
	or
	$ git commit -m'<message>'

###Uploading and downloading changes
Now that we have created the git repository and commited some files we probaly want to upload 
or 'push' the changes to a semi-central location github.com. Assuming that you used github.com 
to create the repoistory to push to and is the repo is called GitGuides then the URL I would use is
https://github.com/mikeizbicki/ucr-cs100.git 
We might also want to download changes that others have made. This is called 'pulling'

##SECTION ?: Git Remote
First to push to a location you will have to add a remote,
a place to download/upload changes from. To view the current remotes for the repo issues the "git remote"
command

	$ git remote

Notice their is not much information in this output. Just the names of the remotes. To get a little 
more detail about the remote use the -v flag

	$ git remote -v

This gives both the remote names as well as their push/push url associated with that remote. Why is their
a seprate url for both push and pull. That is because each can be set seperate for a remote. Now Lets add
a remote. This can be done by telling "git remote" to add a remote. we do this by passing the "add" argument
to git remote. After that argument we pass the name of the remote to add and the url to associate with
that remote name. git remote add <remote name> <url>

	$ git remote add origin https://github.com/<your username>/ucr-cs100.git

Well now that we have a git repository and are tracking changes made from main project what do we do. Its time 

Optionally you specify what branch that 'git push' will push to without arguments by specifying the upstream 
branch to track with. From the current branch we issue the set-upstream subcommand. Since we are on the master 
branch this set the master branch to track the master branch from the remote.

	$ git branch  â€“set-upstream origin/master
	
With the upstream set we can now push the changes to github using
	
	$ git push

Now you may be asking why you didnt have to add the remote when you cloned the first repo. Well when you clone 
a repository using git clone, a tracking branch is set up automatically called master that tracks origin/master.

There you go, now you can get a already created repo, create a repo yourself and you can push changes to the repo. 
You may be wondering, 'How do I get changes from others that commited on the project'. Since that can be a little more 
tricky it will be covered in the next section

#SECTION D: Git fetch and Git Pull
Now that you can create, and push changes to a git repo its time to learn how create a branch and grab external changes. 
Assuming that you have been fallowing the guide up to this point, you have commited to your non-cloned repo, you have 
added a remote and set up a traking branch. I will now show how to pull in changes that others have commited while you
were away. To do this set up a remote to the repository that you wish to update from. This is ussualy called the upstream
repo.

	git remote add upstream https://github.com/mikeizbicki/ucr-cs100.git

So no we have two remotes. One to our own repository and one to the original repository. Lets get a copy of the upstream 
version but let's not make any changes to ours just yet. This is done using the 'fetch' git command. git fetch <repo>

	$ git fetch upstream 

Note that the tags for a repository are not fetch with this command. The need to be explicitly fetched with the --tags
or -t option

	$ git fetch -t upstream
